## Expressions an Statments in Java
### Overview
Repetition is something good ;-)

* An expression has a value.
* A statement describes a behavior. (It does not have a value.)

### Expressions
#### Expression examples of literals
```java
//Expression    //The value of a literal is itself
5               //5	
300.5           //300.5
true            //true
'b'             //'b'
```

#### Expressions with arithmetic operator
```java
//Expression    //Value
5 + 2           //7
5 + 2 * 3       //11
 x = 500        //500 
```

### Statements
#### Variable Declaration Statements  
```java
int x;  
double d;  
char c;  
boolean result;
```
The behavior is that memory is allocated and a variable with a certain type is associated with the memory.

#### Assignment Statements:
```java
x = 500;
d = 20.49 + 30.5 * 24;
c = 'X';
result = false;
 ```
 
The behavior is that the value on the right is assigned to the variable on the left.

NOTE: Assume we are using variables previously defined as above.

#### Combination Declaration/Assignment Statements
```java
int  x = 500;
double d = 20.49 + 30.5 * 24;
char c = 'X';
boolean result = false;
```
